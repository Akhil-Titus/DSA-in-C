## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the building blocks of computer science and programming. This repository provides a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms, implemented in C. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use GCC, Clang, or any other C compiler of your choice.

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.) or CMake
- Basic understanding of C programming

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Akhil-Titus/DSA-in-C
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd DSA-in-C
    ```
3. Make a build directory and navigate into it:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
3. Build with cmake
    ```sh
    cmake .. -G Ninja
    Ninja
    ```
3. Run the executable in build directory
    ```sh
    ./<project_name>.exe
    ```

## Data Structures
